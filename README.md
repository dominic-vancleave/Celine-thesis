## LabelImg Data
Due to the limits of uploading on GitHub, I am unable to upload both the original .json file and the fixed .json file. As of writing this (Jan 2023), I am unsure on whether or not this file is even public information. These files are only used in two of the python scripts above but are an essential part of said files.
